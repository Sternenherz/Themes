This Theme was made by color-picking most of the Cubase 13 interface Elements, then editing Bitwigs theme via https://bitwig.berikai.dev/ 
The PLAY Transport Button, Mute Buttons, Track-Volume-Faders, and other Button Elements are colored in bright white. 
If you want them in a light blue, choose the "Cubase 13 grey-blue" Theme.
Above mentioned elements are the only differences between the themes.

Favorite Settings for me: Bitwig -> User Interface -> Contrast -> Midtones: 35, Black Level 35, Grid Lines 80. 

If you want the default Cubase Color Palette for coloring Clips, you can load "Sternenherz Cubase Colors.png" inside of Bitwig (There's a little button next to the current color palette inside Bitwigs Inspector, where you can load custom images.)

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE PIANO ROLL NOTE HIGHLIGHTING: Since Cubase does not have any kind of visual background-light-highlighting, when selecting notes, and no distracting vertical lines left and right from selected notes, i deleted this visual mess out of the Bitwig Theme. If you want it back, you have to adjust the Theme yourself, sorry! I'm far too happy that this absurdly distracting visual ugliness is gone forever :D So go to https://bitwig.berikai.dev/, load my theme, click on 'Arranger', type "inactive" into the search bar, and look at the parameter to change called: "Time Selection Inactive Fill" - simply make it less transparent to make it visible again. Not sure if i remember correctly, but maybe the vertical lines are "Time Selection Inactive Stroke". Peace
