Made by color-picking most of the Cubase 13 interface Elements, then editing Bitwigs theme via https://bitwig.berikai.dev/ and https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor

Favorite Settings for me: Bitwig -> User Interface -> Contrast -> Midtones: 35, Black Level 35, Grid Lines 80. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Since Cubase does not have any kind of visual background-light-highlighting, when selecting notes, and no distracting vertical lines left and right from selected notes, i deleted this visual mess out of the Bitwig Theme. If you want it back, you have to adjust the Theme yourself, sorry :) So go to https://bitwig.berikai.dev/, load my theme, click on 'Arranger', type "inactive" into the search bar, and look at the parameter to change called: "Time Selection Inactive Fill" - simply make it less transparent to make it visible again. Not sure if i remember correctly, but maybe the vertical lines are "Time Selection Inactive Stroke". Peace
